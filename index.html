            <h1>Welcome to Barangay Manamoc</h1>
            <h2>Lagonoy, Camarines Sur</h2>

            <p><strong>Barangay Manamoc</strong> is a small coastal community in the municipality of Lagonoy (Camarines Sur). It sits on Lagonoy's eastern shoreline, where the mouth of a local stream forms a brackish estuary. The area is characterized by black-sand beaches and tidal flats, and even a small mangrove-nipa swamp at the river mouth. This rural village lies about 10 meters above sea level, and is reached by a provincial road (near the Quinayangan Bridge completed in 2005) that links it with the nearby Sabang coastal area of Lagonoy.</p>

            <h2>History and Culture</h2>
            <p>Manamoc shares in Lagonoy's long history. Lagonoy was established as a Spanish-era town (parish) in 1763 and remained an important local parish under Franciscan missionaries. Colonial records note that the region was repeatedly raided by Moro pirates in the 16th–18th centuries, and that locals farmed rice, corn, root crops and tobacco on the fertile lands around Lagonoy. In this context, Manamoc would have developed as one of Lagonoy's coastside villages.</p>

            <p>The barangay's culture today remains traditionally Bicolano: residents observe the annual fiesta (patron saint's day) as a major event. (In Lagonoy, "each barangay … has their own festivity that coincide with the day of their Patron Saint".) According to local reports, Barangay Manamoc's fiesta is celebrated on June 14. Festivities include religious ceremonies and community gatherings that reflect the area's Catholic and folk traditions.</p>

            <h2>Demographics and Facts</h2>
            <p>Manamoc is a small community. In the 2020 Philippine census its population was 946. In the 2015 census there were 962 residents living in 178 households (about 5.4 persons per household). Thus the population has remained roughly steady (and even dipped slightly) over the past decade. (For reference, the entire town of Lagonoy had 56,714 people in 2020, so Manamoc accounts for about 1.7% of Lagonoy's population.) The village is mostly residential and agricultural, with homes clustered near the coast and farm fields extending inland.</p>

            <h2>Community and Economy</h2>
            <p>Manamoc is primarily a rural, farming-and-fishing community. Many families tend small farms of rice, corn, coconut and other crops – a tradition noted even in early 20th-century accounts of the Lagonoy area. Its location on Lagonoy Gulf also means fishing is an important livelihood for local households.</p>

            <p>The barangay has basic infrastructure to support daily life: for example, a barangay hall, elementary school, and a local health outpost (barangay health station). Manamoc Elementary School is the village's public grade school (it was opened in 1938 under the Lagonoy South school district). Older students typically travel to larger barangays or the town proper for high school. A local barangay road connects Manamoc to the main coastal highway; the nearby Quinayangan Bridge (built in 2005) now links this area to the Sabang port and Naga City route, improving access.</p>

            <p>Every June, the village gathers to celebrate its fiesta – a festive public holiday linked to Manamoc's patron saint. These fiestas are known for their religious masses, street parades, and sharing of local food (in the Lagonoy region, "the barangay fiestas…are famous to many people because of the fun activities, religious events and…especially the food being served in each household"). Through such traditions, Barangay Manamoc maintains a close-knit community life even as it shares in the broader history and economy of Lagonoy town.</p>
