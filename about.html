            <h1>Barangay Manamoc (Lagonoy, Camarines Sur)</h1>

            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>Manamoc’s culture reflects both its coastal identity and traditional crafts. One of the most common natural goods found in the area is <strong>Tuwoy</strong> (native clam shells), which are often gathered along the shoreline and used as food or sometimes repurposed in local trade and household items. Alongside this, the community also takes pride in <strong>karagumoy weaving</strong> – making mats, baskets, and hats from the abundant karagumoy grass. These practices highlight the resourcefulness of the barangay, showing how residents creatively use what nature provides for both livelihood and tradition. The culture of Manamoc is therefore tied to the sea and land, blending practical resource use with a sense of craftsmanship and cooperation.</p>

            <h2>Religion and Festivities</h2>
            <p>Local celebrations in Manamoc center on Catholic traditions, as in most Bicolano villages. Each barangay in Lagonoy has its own festivity that coincides with the feast of its patron saint, and for Manamoc, the patron is <strong>Señor San Antonio de Padua</strong>. The barangay fiesta is held every June in honor of the saint, with masses, processions, and lively cultural presentations. Recently, the community has also highlighted its heritage with the <strong>Karagumoy Festival</strong>, which features street dancing, marching bands, and exhibits of local crafts and foods. These celebrations combine deep religious devotion with folk traditions, strengthening unity and cultural pride among residents.</p>
